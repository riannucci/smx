Simple Markup for XML (SMX or SiMpleX)

SMX is a lean and mean version of XML without all the syntactical redundancy 
and the ability to programatically generate unique attributes for elements.

As a senior project, I will do the following:
    * Define the SMX language
        * Allow smx PIs at beginning to specify other tag containers
        * Formal grammar specification
        * Human tutorial on writing SMX
        * Support for ALL XML features (>, ?>, and C> meaning element, PI, and CDATA respectively)
        * Allow for wildcard replacement tags (*> and **> meaning children and descendants)
        * Allow for multitagging (tag1 && tag2 && tag3 > results in nested tags)
    * Create a python script to convert SMX to XML
    * Create a python script to convert XML to SMX 
    * Web portal for above two
    * Create a java library for parsing SMX directly into DOM
    * Create a java library for parsing DOM to SMX
    * Create IDE helpers:
        * Code editor plugin for editing SMX in Eclipse, NetBeans
        * Syntax highlighting and folding for VIM, EMACS

    * Apache module?
